# dockerfiles
This project aims to provide clean, simple, easy-to-use and lightweight Docker images. I'm maintaing these images because I need them, so I do not recommend using them unless you're ready to do the job ; that also means I won't do much if you're asking for a new feature I don't need myself. Keep in mind I'm very busy, so please consider you'll be most likely on your own if you encounter any kind of issue. No guarantees!

Maintained images are now available on their own repositories (more are to come) :
- [docker/nextcloud](https://github.com/Wonderfall/docker-nextcloud)
- [docker/nginx-php](https://github.com/Wonderfall/docker-nginx-php)
- [docker/ghost](https://github.com/Wonderfall/docker-ghost)
- [docker/matomo](https://github.com/Wonderfall/docker-matomo)
- [docker/isso](https://github.com/Wonderfall/docker-isso)

Unmaintained images are located in the "unmaintained" directory.
